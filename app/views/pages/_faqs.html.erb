    <ul class="first-question">
      <p>It's a conversation via Twitter where anyone can join by putting the #CodeNewbie hashtag in their tweet. We'll moderate from our account, <a href="https://twitter.com/CodeNewbies" target="_blank">@CodeNewbies</a>, and get the conversation started every Wednesday at 9PM EST with some questions on that day's programming topic.</p>

    <h3 class="question">How does it work?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We'll <strong> post a question</strong>, like this one: "Q1: What are your favorite programming books? #CodeNewbie"</li>

      <li>You <strong>respond to the question</strong>, like this: "A1: I loved Chris Pine's 'Learn to Program.' Great book!#CodeNewbie" with the hashtag attached.

      <li>You can also <strong>respond to people directly</strong>, like this: "@codergal what did you like about 'Learn to Program'? I've heard a lot about it! #CodeNewbie"</li>

      <li>After some discussion and back and forth, roughly 5-10 minutes worth, <strong>we'll post a new question</strong> for the community to respond to.</li>

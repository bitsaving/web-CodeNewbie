We talk about working in hardware and software, the difference between studying computer science and actually being an engineer, what he's learned from leading recruitment and interviewing over 100 engineers, and why after all that, he decided to attend a three-month bootcamp to become a web developer. There's also some info on a particularly cool water cooler.",
